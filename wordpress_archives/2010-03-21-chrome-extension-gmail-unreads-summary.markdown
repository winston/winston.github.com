Lately, I have been trying to migrate my Gmail workflow from Firefox to Google Chrome because of its speed. Everything's good, except that since I am so used to my own <a href="www.winstonyw.com/2009/08/08/greasemonkey-script-gmail-unreads-summary/">Greasemonkey script: Gmail Unreads Summary</a> (absolutely essential for a zero-inbox), I always felt a little handicapped in Google Chrome.

As I was sometimes asked the possibility of making a Google Chrome extension for the Greasemonkey script too, I decided finally to do just that.

Therefore, I present <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gjcakikdceplkjdcjclidemkcmdbhlkc">my 1st Google Chrome extension !</a>

<img src="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/images/Chrome_Extension_Gmail_Unreads_Summary.jpg" alt="Gmail Unreads Summary in Google Chrome Extensions Gallery" title="Gmail Unreads Summary in Google Chrome Extensions Gallery" class="clear left" />

Since this extension is actually a remake of the Greasemonkey script which I wrote, the functionality is essentially identical. Thus, quoting from it..

The features of this extension are:
<ul>
	<li>Summary of unread emails in your current view.</li>
	<li>Emails are grouped by sender, with count, sorted in descending order.</li>
	<li>Every group is a quick link to filter emails by sender.</li>
	<li>Easy to use! </li>
</ul>

Hope it just made you more productive!

<strong>Update (29-03-2010)</strong>
I just pushed an update to Google Chrome Extensions gallery which fixes a few bugs. In addition, the sender groups are now sorted by count, in descending order.

Update the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gjcakikdceplkjdcjclidemkcmdbhlkc">Google Chrome extension</a> now!
