The blog design as described in the post below is now history, and can be <a href="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/winstonyw_2006.jpg">seen here</a>.

</div>
As a second post, I believe it is only appropriate to describe the site design, layout and several items which you may be unfamiliar with, or are not commonly seen in normal blogspot or livejournal blogs that work with just a few clicks of the mouse.

Firstly, the original design of this blog is credited to <a title="Thomas SilkjÃ¦r" href="http://blog.theundersigned.net" target="_blank">theundersigned</a>, who have also created several other wordpress template designs. After a week of endless PHP and CSS re-coding, I have successfully modified the original design and layout, and added several "features" to achieve the current state.

The layout is basically separated into 3 major segments:
<ul>
	<li>Top: Navigation</li>
	<li>Middle: Primary Content</li>
	<li>Bottom: Secondary Content</li>
</ul>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
As the name suggests, you navigate the blog with the links.
<h3>Primary Content</h3>
On the index page, you see 2 columns. The larger column contains the content of the LATEST POST, while the smaller column contains information about the other latest activities on the blog, such as the "Latest Posts" and "Latest Comments".

That was quite intuitive, but did you notice several icons at the end of the LATEST POST? If you know what they are, you may skip this paragraph. Those icons are known as "Social Links". Basically what it does, if you click on any of the icons, is that it would post (or bookmark) the article which you were reading to the corresponding bookmarking and social-sharing site, such as digg or del.icio.us. That is, of course, assuming you already have a registered account under one of those sites. Anyway, this makes it really convenient for anyone who would like to bookmark certain articles for future references.

Another feature associated to each article is "Tags". With the proliferation of Web 2.0 methodologies, it is no longer adequate to file articles under categories only. For easier search and archival purposes, it is best to associate tags to the articles as well, so that there exists a more descriptive record for the article rather than just a broad category name, and vieweres would also be able to gauge, at a glance, the content an article entails.
<h3>Secondary Content</h3>
In this area, you would find not-so-important information.

Again, this area is divided into 2 columns. The larger column contains excerpts of the earlier posts, my <a title="My Digg" href="http://www.digg.com/winstonyw" target="_blank">digg</a> and <a title="My Del.icio.us" href="http://www.delicious.com/winstonyw" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> links, and <a title="My Flickr Account" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/winstonyw" target="_blank">photos from my Flickr</a>. The smaller column mainly contains archival information, based on timeline, categories and tags.

As the name suggests, excerpts are short snippets of a post. To be exact, the excerpts shown on my blog contains 120 words, with HTML stripped. To read the entire content of the post, click on title of the post and you would be directed to another page.

What are "my digg and del.icio.us links"? These are 2 websites I visit daily. For interesting news or sites featured on digg, del.icio.us, or discovered by myself, I would bookmark them in either digg or del.icio.us and they would be displayed on my blog as links. So in a nutshell, you would be able to see the latest headline which caught my attention. Check out the <a title="Remove WGA" href="http://www.delicious.com/winstonyw/remove+wga" target="_blank">Remove-Windows Genuine Advantage links</a> I have which saved quite a lot of people.

As for the other items found in the "Secondary Content" area, they should be quite self-explanatory.

I hope you found this description of the site layout helpful, and that it cleared most of your doubts as to what certain things were? Basically, I have chosen to present, in my blog, information which I appreciated for their significance in making this blog look "fresh" and I hope you would as well. Suppose I do not have any posts, then check out the latest comments or even the latest links I discovered.
