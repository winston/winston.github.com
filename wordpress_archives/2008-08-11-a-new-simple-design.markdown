After a hiatus of nearly two years, I want to start blogging actively again. This new design is created for that purpose, as a celebration of my return to blogging. 

I have it made to be just a plain and simple blog design that's absent of many colours or other funky design elements, as I hope that the content would eventually be the main draw. But, I also have it optimized in several aspects to make it look aesthetically pleasing (at least to me).

Firstly, the main fonts are 13px at least, and there's a line height of 1.5em between the lines to make sure that paragraphs are easily readable. Secondly, for every paragraph, the number of words per line is in the range of 12-18 words which is what I understand as the optimum number of words per line. Thirdly, I am using a grid layout that further enhances readability. Last but not least, I am using dark coloured wordings on a white background which is the safest colour combination for any blog design. You may disagree with me on all the aspects I listed above, but well, those are what I believe in.

Anyway, I don't call myself a designer and this blog is a culmination of inspirations I got from a number of blogs. This list is not exhaustive, but the following are the ones that I felt had the strongest influence in my new blog design:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.subtraction.com">Subtraction</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish Theme</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://woork.blogspot.com">Woork</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mellenweg</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com">Chris Brogan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.problogger.com">ProBlogger</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a></li>
</ul>

As of this writing, this blog design is almost complete. But I am still looking to integrate <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com/winstonyw">my FriendFeed</a> into the blog. I had a look at the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/friendfeed-activity-widget/">FriendFeed plugin</a>, but am not extremely fond of it. So, for now I would sit on it while I brainstorm for fresh ideas on how to do the integration.

That's all I have to say about my new blog design. I hope you like it as much as I do, and I welcome feedback or suggestions!
