      <p>The most "famous" that I ever got (on the Internet) was getting a mention on both <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com">Download Squad</a> and <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">Techmeme</a> in 2006, and that was a great achievement for me! All of it began with <a href="http://www.winstonyw.com/2006/11/03/greasemonkey-script-gmail-and-reader-integrator/">a Greasemonkey script that I wrote</a>, which basically integrates Google Reader into Gmail.</p>

<p>Back then, I merely <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-past/browse_thread/thread/af129cfade115e62/90088d791266952a?q=#90088d791266952a">shared my script on Google Reader's Google Group</a>, but I got an encouraging reply from <a href="http://blog.davebc.com/">David Chartier</a> who was then a blogger for Download Squad. Soon, the script got <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/11/03/new-better-greasemonkey-script-to-combine-gmail-and-google-reade/">a dedicated post on Download Squad</a>, written by <a href="http://www.jasonclarke.net">Jason Clarke</a>. Surprise, surprise! After which, more people came to know of the script, and it was <a href="http://delicious.com/url/98c71549d280d7f0af91f08e995aa1d7">delicious-ed a total of 144 times</a>. By the following day, <strong><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/061104/p8#a061104p8">I was listed on Techmeme</a></strong>. Wow! Techmeme! Have you <strong>EVER</strong> been listed on Techmeme?!</p>

<p>Anyway, I soon neglected the maintenance of the script due to other commitments, but <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/7435">a</a> <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/8450">few</a> <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/14030">others</a> continued to make further improvements to my Greasemonkey script. Eventually, the functionality of the script was acknowledged by <a href="http://www.ginatrapani.org/">Gina of Lifehacker</a>, and one of the improved version was included into the Better Gmail Firefox extension. Even though I was not named as the author of the script, but I was still able to see that I was credited in the comments section of the script, and that's good enough for me.</p>

<p>Just an egoistic post to document one of my (lesser-known) greater achievements, and I wonder if I'll ever achieve such "fame" again.</p>

<p>What about you? What's your claim to fame?</p>
