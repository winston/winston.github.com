      <p>In my <a href="http://www.winstonyw.com/2008/05/28/installing-lighttpd-and-php-on-windows/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I described how to get PHP working with LightTPD on a Windows machine. But that's not the end of the story, since what I really wanted was to get my local WordPress installation working, and the missing piece to the puzzle is to make sure that PHP is enabled for MySQL use.</p>

<p>To do that, simply edit the following in the php.ini file:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Load MySQL extensions from the correct directory: extension_dir = "c:\php\ext"</li>
    <li>Remove the comment tag for: extension=php_mysql.dl"</li>
</ul>


<p>A simple post that's really supposed to be appended to the previous post, but I had some problems trying to get the get the code tag working, so I prefer not to touch that post again.</p>

<p>Anyway, my WordPress is in the htdocs directory right now, waiting for me to start some serious templating.</p>
