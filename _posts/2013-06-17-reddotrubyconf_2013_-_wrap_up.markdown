title: RedDotRubyConf 2013 - Wrap Up
---

It's been a week since RDRC 2013. Time to do a wrap up!

For those who have missed it, I have also written a
[Thank You](http://winstonyw.com/2013/06/12/reddotrubyconf_2013_-_thank_you/) note which also contains links to related resources.

## RDRC 2013

Andy Croll came to Neo office last Oct/Nov for a UXD session and gently broke the news to some of us
after the event that he's going to go back to UK soon and would like to handover RedDotRubyConf to someone.

After days of consideration, and support from Carl,
I decide to take it on and my co-workers also gladly offered to help out.

Personally, I really wanted to take it on because I want to contribute back to the Ruby community in Singapore
as I wouldn't be who I am or where I am if not for Ruby.

And, there's also a little of bit national pride involved.
Why isn't any local taking on a more active role to promote such technical events?

## ToDo List By Priority

In December, I got down to work. These were the stuff that I had to do, arranged according to importance.

### Great Speakers
We have all heard of them and seen them in videos. How cool would it be to see them in person!
I was audacious and I sent out emails to a number of them. 7 said yes, and you know the rest.
I was actually prepared to be rejected by all of them and so I am really grateful for their replies.
Anyway, with the few big names, that helped to drive the early ticket sales too.

I think I was really lucky. Next year, I hope I'll be as lucky!

### Venue
RDRC required a venue that's accessible and inexpensive.
There were several choices, namely:

- Lecture Theatres in National University of Singapore
- NUS Alumni House / Shaw Foundation
- RedDot Museum
- NTUC Auditorium
- NUS UCC
- Biopolis

Biopolis was the best option out of them all, because it's near to the train station, and it's inexpensive as compared to most of the other choices.Lecture Theatres in National Univeristy of Singapore were, unfortunately, only available for students use. Not even an alumni, during the hols.

### Other Logistics
After checking off the 2 todos above, the conference logistics had to be taken care of next.

### Drinks
For drinks, I ordered a total of 800+ bottles of mineral water and 1200+ cans of soda.
Given a conference attendee of about 300 over 2 days,
I calculated that a person would drink an average of 3 bottles/cans of beverages and that's how I came up with the estimates.

However, at the end of Day 2, there were still about 12-16 cartons of mineral water and soda left.
You guys are not drinking enough water!

## Improvements

### First Timers
Not everyone is a seasoned/professional speaker from Day one.
If every conference is out looking for only good speakers, how can anyone start being a speaker?
We made sure that we evaluated speakers based mainly on the topic that they proposed,
and that the topic will add value and complement the overall lineup.

I have heard feedback about talks that discussed personal gems to be less interesting and I beg to differ.
Engineers, like you and I, who made something worthwhile in their spare time,
and deserve a platform to share their knowledge.
If you made a gem, you should be proud to share it too! Nothing's too small to be unworthy of sharing.

As a result, we had an interesting mix of speakers from all over the World.
And hopefully after RDRC, many will continue to improve on their presentation skills and become great speakers!
