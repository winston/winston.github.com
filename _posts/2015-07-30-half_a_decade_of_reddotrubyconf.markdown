title: Half A Decade Of RedDotRubyConf
---

This year, 2015, is the fifth run of RDRC and it's my third time organising it.
Nevertheless, it's not in anyway easier
because expectations have definitely gone up over the years,
and I would like to do something about the feedback collected last year. :)

The preparation started 6 months before the conference, and it always began with the venue and dates.
I picked Biopolis again because it's really affordable, and that means ticket prices can stay low.

Then I started to shortlist and invite several key speakers, one of whom is Matz.
I really wanted to have Matz at RedDotRubyConf 2015,
as he was here in 2011 and so I thought it would be special to have him back again 4 years later.
But alas! Matz wasn't able  make it for the dates (May 28, 29) which I originally planned for.. What? OMG!

Like I said, I had really, really wanted to have Matz at RedDotRubyConf 2015!
So I went back to the venue and asked for a few other available dates
and luckily one of it suited Matz's schedule. Phew!
And the rest was history as Aaron, Sam, Linda, Laurent and Jesse then all agreed to come too!

The months went by quickly from January onwards as we took care of the logistical challenges of the conference.
Too much to say here, but did I mention I am trying to write an open source Conference Planning Guide?

Finally June 4, 5 came and went by quickly and I really couldn't have done it without the help of
[Guo Xiang](https://twitter.com/tgx_world),
[Jingwen](https://twitter.com/jin_),
[Elisha](https://twitter.com/elishatan),
[Anna](https://twitter.com/anna_fil),
[Laurence](https://twitter.com/laurenceputra) and
[Cheeaun](https://twitter.com/cheeaun).
They helped covered the grounds that I wasn't able to attend to and were instrumental in making the conference a success.
Thank you!

## Thank You Sponsors!

Our sponsors were awesome and I can't thank them enough!
Their sponsorships are a validation of the conference, boosts of confidence to us,
and also helped prevent us from going into the red because
ticket sales alone are never enough to cover the full cost of the conference.

In any case, our sponsors just wanted to do their bit to help build the Ruby community
and I hope RDRC had helped them snag a few more deals or new hires.

## Thank You Speakers

Speakers - They are the soul of the conference. Thank you all so much!

25 Speakers - 6 Key Notes, 9 CFPs and 9 Lightning Talks.

We had topics about Ruby (and mRuby), Rails, RubyMotion, Robotics,
Security, Refactoring, Optimization, Open Source, etc,
and this year, we had a Panel discussion on Ruby for the first time
which was very well-received!

I learned a lot from all the talks and I hope you did too.
You can enjoy the talks again as
[they are now available on Confreaks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7tQUdRKcyZdMYKatu_nics8Pkjxl3-F).

## Thank YOU!!!

As I have always said, RDRC is for you, and you, and you!

Almost 350 Rubyists from all over the World gathered together for 2 days
to celebrate Ruby on the tiny island called Singapore.

Thank you for making this possible. Thank you all for your support!

Let's continue to make the Ruby community even better!

## Closing

Honestly, imo, this was the best RDRC among the last 3 that I organised.
First year was about making sure I don't mess up and that the RDRC brand continued to grow.
Second year was about repeating the same feat (while juggling with [starting my own consultancy](http://www.jollygoodcode.com/)).
This year, it was about taking care of the finer details, so that everyone felt welcomed.

Things that I felt we did well:

- We had buses that brought speakers (who were staying at the conference hotel) to Biopolis
- We had better breakfasts and tea breaks
- We had barista-style coffee/tea because developers care for their daily fix
- We had vegetarian lunch boxes for attendees who indicated on registration that they were vegetarian
- We had cleaners to make sure the venue was kept spick and span
- We had activities like a RubyMotion workshop, RailsGirls and Git Workshop around the conference

If I were to give RDRC 2015 a score, I would say we have scored 90 marks. Haha.

Organising a conference is challenging and tiring, but at the same time, fun and rewarding!

That's all folks! :)
