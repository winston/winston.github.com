Since the start of this blog in 2006, I have it hosted for free with Futureworkz because of a special ex-relationship with the business. This gesture of goodwill, I am truly appreciative of it; and you can easily guess how much I saved over the last 3+ years.

About two weeks ago, I received an update that their server operations will be shifted from the US to Singapore by the end of the month, and that they will be migrating my account and continuing to provide me with free hosting. Wow! That's really very nice, considering the fact that I am a "free customer".

Nevertheless, I felt that all good things must come to an end, and that I really shouldn't continue to leech on them since they are operating a business. Moreover, I am no longer a part of the business, and so rightly, I should move my butt elsewhere. Therefore, I thanked them for their goodwill and declined their offer. 

Thanks for the 3+ years of free hosting. Thank you!

Anyway, so having decided that I am going to shift my butt elsewhere, I set out to look for an awesome web host. Actually, I already have a web host in mind, and thanks to an affiliate code from <a href="http://blog.codefront.net">Chu Yeow</a>, I migrated this blog to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a> on 8th July. The migration was simple, and I even made use of the opportunity to upgrade my WordPress to version 2.8.1 (which was further upgraded to 2.8.2 using the fantastic one-click upgrade feature).

Till now, I am a satisfied customer of DreamHost, and these are some of the things that I really like so far:
<ul>
	<li>The Control Panel is easy to use and configure.</li>
	<li>They have a brilliant customer support system in the form of a Wiki.</li>
	<li>To connect to SSH/FTP/MySQL, server alias is simply [protocol].[hostname].</li>
	<li>Transparent status updates at: http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/</li>
</ul>

Now that I am on paid hosting, I must continue to blog (more , more!) and try to make some returns on investment, so expect to hear more from me!
