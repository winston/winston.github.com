Lately, I have been thinking of ways to organize and consolidate my online activities. This is largely because I have a distributed footprint in a number of online services, and this distribution is somewhat random and messy. I'll like to have some guidelines so that I'll know where to post, what to post and how to post. Thus, birth of this post.

Currently, <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> is doing a wonderful job in <a href="http://friendfeed.com/winstonyw">aggregating all my online services</a>, and so I will continue to leverage on this core functionality. However, at the same time, I want to categorize my online activities and target them to different audiences, and hopefully with this categorization, I'll have answered the three questions above.

Starting with this blog, I shall continue to do my geeky writings on Winston{YW} since that has been the main focus of this blog. Moreover, I already have a few geeky posts here that are <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=ruby+soap4r">ranked</a> <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=mysql+select+timestamp">highly</a> in Google searches and these posts continue to bring in a stream of fellow-geeks, whom I suppose are only interested in other geeky writings.

In addition, I am going to create a <a href="http://winstonyw.posterous.com">multimedia blog</a>, which will contain my very own images, videos and sounds. <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a> seems to be the oh-so perfect choice for this, as I can simply email my multimedia files to the service and my files will be magically converted and hosted intelligently, as an image gallery, or a video/music player! That's really simple, as compared to a self-hosted WordPress blog.

For a start, I'll be using Posterous as a replacement for Twitpic, since this service is able to auto-post to Twitter (and other services) and it's a nicer archives of my images. Next, I'll be posting random photos taken with my (newly-bought!) Panasonic Lumix LX3 onto Posterous too.

Posts from these two blogs will be fed into FriendFeed, along with services such as Twitter, Delicious and Google Reader for an aggregated and commentable view. Unless you are not subscribed to me on FriendFeed, you are probably already overwhelmed by my activities-stream.

However, I know that not everyone gets FriendFeed, and you might only be interested in my blog/s. Therefore, I'll be offering not one, not two, but THREE RSS feeds:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/winstonyw/wordpress">The 1st feed is for this blog.</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/winstonyw/posterous">The 2nd feed is for my multimedia blog at Posterous.</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/winstonyw">The 3rd (default) feed is a combined feed</a> of the two feeds above, courtesy of <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a>.</li>
</ul>

As for <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, I'll continue to use it to stream my daily life, retweet interesting tweets, share funny videos and socialize with the crowd. Are you interested in "stalking" me? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/winstonyw">Join Twitter and Follow Me</a>. That is where I am spending most of my time. 

What about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/winstonyw">my Facebook</a>? I have installed the Selective Twitter app on Facebook, so that any tweets with a hashtag of #fb will be piped into Facebook as well. In this way, I'll also be able to interact with my Facebook friends when I tweet.

That's the gist of my online strategy for now, and as trivial as it sounds, I actually spent quite some time mulling over it. Let's see how my plan will evolve over time.. 

Do you have an online strategy of your own?
