Today, I spent about an hour or so creating a (very simple) site favicon for Winston{YW}. There are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=create+favicon" target="_blank">a number of tutorials out there</a> that provide easy-to-understand instructions on how to create your own site favicon, but I found <a href="http://www.photoshopsupport.com/tutorials/jennifer/favicon.html" target="_blank">the one by Jennifer</a> most detailed.

Ideally, you should be able to see this on your URL bar and (Firefox) tab:

<img class="clear" src="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/images/My_Favicon.jpg" alt="My Favicon" />

I know this cannot be compared to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/31/inspire-yourself-50-remarkable-favicons/" target="_blank">those featured by SmashingMagazine</a>, but at least it's my own unique creation.
