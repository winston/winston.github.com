title: Singapore Rails InstallFest
---

# Background

For the last year, I have been toying with the idea of starting a basic Ruby on Rails class to help people get started in Ruby on Rails.
I was interested in doing this because I am interested in growing the Ruby community in Singapore, and in spreading my love for Ruby.

However, I didn't have time to work on the materials, and so I never got anything started.

One day, I came across [this thread on "Ruby or Rails Oceania Google Group"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rails-oceania/8pXB_JP7SbY)
about Rails InstallFest, and I was immediately excited - I could bring this to Singapore!

And so, I emailed Mikel of reInteractive to enquire about the possibility and he referred me to Chloe, reInteractive's Community Manager
who was really enthusiastic about helping to get us started with Rails InstallFest.

# The Event

Rails InstallFest happened on 5 Oct 2013, 9:30am at Silicon Straits CO.LAB.

At first, I was really worried about the turnout as it poured in the morning on 5 Oct.
But my fears were unfounded as we saw a total of 27 partcipants (out of 36 registered) and 7 volunteer coaches.

The particpants came from all sorts of background including product/business folks, developers, designers and students.
Despite the varid background, all of them came with an open mind to learn about Ruby on Rails!

For our first Rails InstallFest, this is what the partipants have to do:

1. Get Ruby on Rails installed on your machine using [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org)
2. Follow this [blog post](http://blog.reinterative.net/posts/32) and get a blog depolyed on Heroku

At the end of the day, all of the 27 participants have Ruby on Rails installed on their personal machines,
and about half of them got a simple blog deployed on Heroku. Success!

# Thank You

reInteractive really helped a lot in making the first Rails InstallFest a success,
as Chloe was always on the email with me, sending me materials and vouchers for the session.
Without their support, the event wouldn't have been possible. Thank you Chloe and reInteractive!

We also required a venue for the event, and James readily offered the swanky Silicon Straits CO.LAB for the Rails InstallFest.
The venue was really cosy and conducive for learning as a lot of the participants remarked in their feedback,
and I am really grateful to James for helping us out! Thank you James and Silicon Straits!

Not to forget, the 7 coaches: Chong-Yee, Jeffrey, Jaryl, Kevin, Paul, Ray Chuan and Sean!
Thank you so much!

The Ruby community in SG is so full of love.
When I first announced the event, several of them already volunteered themselves
(including Ming Ding and Justin who were sorely missed because they were ill).
And when I asked again for more help about a week before the event,
a few more voluntereed too.
WIthout these guys who are so passionate about community, the first ever Rails InstallFest couldn't have been a success.
Thank you guys!

# Improvements

Nothing is perfect, and so is the event. We collected feedback from the participants and the overall sentiment is that
the Rails InstallFest was a really useful session to help them get started in Ruby on Rails.

At the same time, most remarked that the volunteer coaches were approachable, friendly and helpful.
Together with the conducive environment, they found learning RoR to be easy.

The gripe with some was that there should have been a brief walkthrough of the blog post to give a broad overview of each step,
so that they would not just be following the blog post blindly.

In addition, there's a comment to group the participants into small learning teams so that they can ask each other as well.

Overall, I enjoyed running the first Rails InstallFest in SG,
and I am sure we'll continue to have more RoR training sessions in the future. =)
