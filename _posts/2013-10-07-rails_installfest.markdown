title: Singapore Rails InstallFest
---

## Background

For the last year, I have been toying with the idea of starting a basic Ruby on Rails class to help people get started in Ruby on Rails.

I wanted to do it because I am interested in growing the Ruby community in Singapore.
However, I didn't have time to work on the materials, and so I never got anything started.

One day, I came across [this thread on "Ruby or Rails Oceania"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rails-oceania/8pXB_JP7SbY)
about Rails InstallFest, and I was immediately excited as it seems to be aligned with what I had in mind.

And so, I emailed Mikel of reInteractive to enquire about the possibility and he referred me to Chloe, reInteractive's Community Manager
who was really enthusiastic about helping us get started with the Rails InstallFest.

## The Event

Rails InstallFest happened on 5 Oct 2013, 9:30am at Silicon Straits CO.LAB.

At first, I was really worried about the turnout as it poured heavily in the morning on 5 Oct.
But my fears were unfounded as we saw a total of 27 partcipants and 8 volunteer coaches.
The particpants came from all sorts of background including product/business folks, developers, designers and students.

For our first Rails InstallFest, this is what the partipants have to do:

- Get Ruby on Rails installed on your machine using [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org)
- Follow this [blog post](http://blog.reinterative.net/posts/32) and get a blog deployed on Heroku

At the end of the day, all of the participants got Ruby on Rails installed on their laptops,
and about half of them got a simple blog deployed on Heroku. Success!

## Thank You

reInteractive really helped a lot in making the first Rails InstallFest a success,
as Chloe was always on the email with me, and sending me materials and vouchers for the session.
Without them, the event wouldn't have happened. Thank you Chloe and reInteractive!

We also required a venue for the event, and James readily offered Silicon Straits CO.LAB.
The venue was really _cosy_ and _conducive for learning_ as remarked by a number of the participants in their feedback,
and I am really grateful to James for loaning the place to us! Thank you James and Silicon Straits!

The Singapore Ruby community is also full of love!
When I first announced the event, several immediately volunteered to help out.
And when I asked again for additional help, many readily stepped up.

Thank you Chong-Yee, Jeffrey, Jaryl, Kevin, Paul, Ray Chuan and Sean
for volunteering your time on a Saturday morning as coaches!

## Improvements

We collected feedback from the participants and the overall sentiment is that
the Rails InstallFest was a really useful session to help them get started in Ruby on Rails.

At the same time, most remarked that the volunteer coaches were approachable, friendly and helpful.
Together with the conducive environment, they found learning RoR to be easy.

The gripe with some was that there should have been a brief walkthrough of the blog post to give a broad overview of each step,
so that they would not just be following the blog post blindly.

In addition, there's a comment to group the participants into small learning teams so that they form a study support.

Overall, I enjoyed running the first Rails InstallFest in SG,
and I am sure we'll continue to have more RoR training sessions in the future. =)

Pictures to come soon..
