title: RedDotRubyConf 2013 - Thank You
---

I didn't do this alone - RDRC 2013 is an event by the community, for the community.

[Abhaya](https://twitter.com/abhayashenoy), [Wei](https://twitter.com/luweidewei), [Mohan](https://twitter.com/mohangk), and many more all helped to make this happen. They are my heros!

**Firstly, I would like to thank [Andy](http://twitter.com/andycroll) - founder of RDRC.**

Without him, RedDotRubyConf would not had happened in 2011 and 2012, and he gave us a great conference structure which I mostly copied for RDRC 2013.

Throughout the months of preparing for RDRC 2013, he was also ever helpful in providing suggestions and encouragement to us.

Thank you, Andy! We missed your British humour, but we all know that Singapore has to be independent someday right? =)

**Secondly, a big thank you to all the speakers who made time for RDRC 2013.**

24 speakers in all - 7 "Key Notes", 12 CFPs, and 5 Lightning Talks.

You guys are awesome, and the knowledge and experience that you shared with the us during the 2 days was priceless.

We have all leveled up, and it's because of you guys.

Thank you! Hope to see you all again, somewhere, someday.

**Lastly, I would like to thank everyone who attended RDRC 2013.**

300+ Rubyists from all over the World. Thank you for your support!

I am also touched and encouraged by the lovely feedback that I have received thus far, and I am really grateful for making new friends amongst you all.

_A little jealous though, because you all had more time to chat with the speakers than me!_

I had a great time at RDRC 2013 and I hope everyone enjoyed themselves too.

See you all next year!
