          <h2>Singapore Rails InstallFest</h2>
          <span class="date">07 OCTOBER 2013</span>
          <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>

<p>For the last year, I have been toying with the idea of starting a basic Ruby on Rails class to help people get started with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I wanted to do it to grow the Ruby community in Singapore, and because teaching is FUN!
However, I didn't have time to work on the materials, and so I never got anything started.</p>

<p>One day, I came across <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rails-oceania/8pXB_JP7SbY">this thread on "Ruby or Rails Oceania"</a>
about Rails InstallFest, and I was immediately excited as it seems to be aligned with what I had in mind.</p>

<p>And so, I emailed <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaar">Mikel</a> of <a href="http://www.reinteractive.net/">reInteractive</a> to enquire about the possibility and he referred me to Chloe, reInteractive's Community Manager
who was really enthusiastic about helping us get started with the Rails InstallFest.</p>

<h2>The Event</h2>

<p>Rails InstallFest happened on 5 Oct 2013, 9:30am at <a href="http://siliconstraits.com/">Silicon Straits CO.LAB</a>.</p>

<p>At first, I was really worried about the turnout as it poured heavily in the morning on 5 Oct.
But my fears were unfounded as we saw a total of 27 partcipants and 8 volunteer coaches.
The particpants came from all sorts of background including product/business folks, developers, designers and students.</p>

<p>For our first Rails InstallFest, this is what the partipants have to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get Ruby on Rails installed on your machine using the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org">Rails Installer</a></li>
<li>Follow this <a href="http://blog.reinterative.net/posts/32">blog post</a> and get a blog deployed on Heroku</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end of the day, all of the participants got Ruby on Rails installed on their laptops,
and about half of them got a simple blog deployed on Heroku. Yea!</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>reInteractive really helped a lot in making the first Singapore Rails InstallFest a success.
Especially Chloe, who helped made sure I have all that I need - materials and vouchers!
Without them, the event wouldn't have happened. Thank you reInteractive and Chloe!</p>

<p>We also required a venue for the event, and James readily offered his space for our use.
Silicon Straits was really <em>cosy</em> and <em>conducive for learning</em> as remarked by a number of the participants in their feedback,
and I am really grateful to James for loaning out his space! Thank you James and Silicon Straits!</p>

<p>And finally, all I can say is that the Singapore Ruby community is sooooooo full of love!
After I annouced the event and asked for volunteer coaches, many stepped up!</p>

<p>Thank you Chong-Yee, Jeffrey, Jaryl, Kevin, Paul, Ray Chuan and Sean
for volunteering your time on a Saturday morning as coaches!</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<p>We collected feedback from the participants and the overall sentiment is that
the class was a really useful session to help them get started in Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>At the same time, most remarked that the volunteer coaches were friendly and helpful.
Together with the conducive environment, they found learning RoR to be easy.</p>

<p>However, it would have been better if we did a brief walkthrough of the blog post exercise,
so that the participants can better appreciate and understand what they were doing,
and not just blindly follow the blog post.</p>

<p>In addition, there's also a suggestion to group the participants into small learning teams so that they interact and learn from one another within their small groups.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed running the first Rails InstallFest in SG,
and I am sure we'll continue to have more RoR training sessions in the future. =)</p>

<p>Time for some pictures!</p>
