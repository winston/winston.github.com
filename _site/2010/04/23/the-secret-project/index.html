      <p>I have a lot of ideas, but as everyone (including myself) says:</p>

<blockquote>Ideas are Cheap</blockquote>


<p>Ideas are only worthwhile when you execute.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been feeling the urge to turn some of my ideas into reality, because:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I want to scratch my itches, and verify that my ideas are useful.</li>
    <li>I should continue to code and code, and learn and learn.</li>
    <li>I am awed and inspired by <a href="http://www.imayday.com/">May Day</a>, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9780091929787/ReWork?a_aid=winstonyw">Rework</a>, and friends.</li>
    <li>I hope to find alternative / passive income.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I have decided to focus on one of the many ideas, and it's a secret for now. The idea may not be anything grand, but I believe (and hope) that it solves a problem, and will be something useful for the target market.</p>

<p>I'll post my progress as often as I can, and hopefully, I'll be able to reveal it soon.</p>

<p>For a start, I registered the domain name last night.</p>

<p>Now, to start designing the database schema..</p>
