      <p>A few days ago, I found a JQuery selector that can be used to select the first visible form input element on a page:
[code language="js"]
$(':input:visible:enabled:first')
[/code]
This selector can further be used to focus on the first form input element on page load, as seen in the following code snippet:
[code language="js"]
$(function () {
  $(window).load(function () {</p>

<pre><code>$(':input:visible:enabled:first').focus();
</code></pre>

<p>  });
})
[/code]
In the code snippet above, I placed the focus event call inside the load function (bounded to the window element) so that the focus event fires when the browser finishes loading all content within a document, including window, objects and images. Initially though, I had excluded the load function and had placed the focus event call within only the DOM ready function, but it failed to work.</p>

<p>This simple trick is great for usability, as the user can start filling up a form right away without any additional mouse clicks or key strokes, since the cursor would appear in the first form input element once the page has finished loading.</p>

<p>Google and Yahoo, for example, focus the user's cursor in their search box on page load so that the user can start a search conveniently. In their industry where every search counts towards achieving their business goals, such usability enhancement, though small and subtle, can make a difference.</p>

<p>However, do note that this may only be good for pages that need to focus the user's attention on a form's input field, or for pages whose primary content is a form. Else, it becomes more of an annoyance to find the cursor focused on some obscure form input field on every page load.</p>
