This script does not work with the new version of Gmail and due to misc. commitments, I am not able to devote effort and time to improve this script (as much as I would like to). For similar functionality and more, please take a look at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-gmail-2-firefox-extension-for-new-gmail-320618.php">LifeHacker's Better Gmail 2 Firefox extension</a>.

Thank you once again for the overwhelming response!

Previously, if your default start-page  in "Settings" was "Home", it was redirected to "All". This has now been modified such that no redirection occurs, and "Home" is displayed.

Thanks to David for pointing this out. <a title="The Script" href="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/scripts/gmailreaderintegrator.user.js" target="_blank">Download the updated script</a>.
<div class="update_header">Update on 9th November 2006</div>
There is a programming bug, specifically a variable name error on Line 304 in the script. The variable name for the Google Reader shared items URL should be <em>READER_BROADCAST_URL</em> and <strong>NOT</strong> <em>READER_SHARED_URL</em>. Sorry for the mistake! Download the <a title="The Script" href="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/scripts/gmailreaderintegrator.user.js" target="_blank">updated script, again</a>.
<div class="update_header">Update on 6th November 2006</div>
I removed the Reader view when "Contacts" link is clicked as it "damages" the interface. Download the <a title="The Script" href="http://www.winstonyw.com/uploads/scripts/gmailreaderintegrator.user.js" target="_blank">updated script</a>. No other changes to the rest of the script logic.

<h3>The Not-So-Short Story</h3>


<p>Recently when <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html">Google reintroduced Google Reader</a> with a new look, new features and improved usability, they marketed it as the "Inbox for the Web". Immediately, the word "inbox" associates the Reader to emails, and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5980861656829941065&amp;sourceid=docidfeed&amp;hl=en">Chris Wetherell - Google Reader Engineer</a>, explained that using the Reader to obtain the latest updates of your favourite websites is similar to reading your emails. You just wait for the updates to be sent to your inbox.</p>

<p>Within the same day, the Reader created a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/28/google-reader-steps-it-up-with-new-version/">huge</a> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_reader_redesign.php">buzz</a> and I gave it a try. Previously, I wasn't accustomed to the not-so-intuitive interface of the historical version and so chose to use <a href="http://www.winstonyw.com/www.rojo.com">Rojo</a> as my RSS aggregator instead. But after exploring the new Reader, I was excited about the changes which Google introduced and have started using it as my default RSS reader.</p>

<p>Then, I found this <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">Greasemonkey script by Mihai Parparita</a>, from <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-reader/integrate-google-reader-with-gmail-via-greasemonkey-207679.php">a post in Lifehacker</a>, which embeds the Reader into Gmail. This makes perfect sense! They both are inboxes and ideally, they should belong on the same page. Moreover, I use Gmail frequently at work and the interface integration is an amazing productivity hack.</p>

<p>However, I felt that it wasn't adequate for my use, and that my wish-functionalities were similar to comments left on Mihai's Blog and Lifehacker. Therefore, I decided to write my own script to integrate Gmail and Google Reader; even though I have never written a Greasmonkey script before.</p>

<p>By examining Mihai's code, I was able to learn and understand how a <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/">Greasemonkey script is written with Javascript</a>. Then, I took about 1.5 weeks to complete coding my version of the Gmail and Reader Integrator, with a list of features that brought more functionalities to the integration. Importantly, I should bring to attention that I reused certain functions written by Mihai for convenience, and I acknowledged these functions clearly in my script. Thank you Mihai for the inspiration and wonderful code.</p>

<p>Lastly, please do report any bugs encountered or feedback any suggestions for possible improvements. I hope that you would find my Gmail and Reader Integrator script useful, as much as I do.</p>
