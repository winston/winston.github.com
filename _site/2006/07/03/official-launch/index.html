      <p>Aloha!! This day marks the beginning of "The Next Phase", a new blog that celebrates the end (for at least a few years) of my education and the start of another stage in life. Purposefully, today is also the 1st day of my career in a MNC far, far away from my residence.</p>

<p>Do update your links as I wouldn't be updating the old blog anymore, and that would just be left to rot in cyberspace. Knowing me, you might ask if this blog would last? I wonder.. Most probably I would only be able to blog with the time I have left after deducting work, travel, eat and sleep from 24 hours a day? Oooh.. That's like 5min left per day..</p>

<p>This should be enough for a starter post and I took 5min.</p>

<p>I'll blog more when I have more to blog. I WILL!!</p>
